## 3. Research Operations
### 3.1 Repository Structure
- Collections: Interviews, Surveys, Trend Radar, Accessibility Panel, Analytics Insights.
- Tagging: persona (style_maven/creator/guardian), emotion, theme, priority.
- Workflow: Upload artifact ? tag ? link to backlog/PRD ? share in Monday digest ? archive after 12 months.

### 3.2 Current Insights (Sep 2025)
- Diary study: Reduced motion toggle needs higher prominence; led to settings sprint.
- Analytics: Capsules active deliver 12% faster completions vs. default theme.
- Trend radar: Analog ink overlays trending; action item to commission illustrator.

## 4. Analytics Framework
- **Pillars**: Experience quality, emotional engagement, accessibility & comfort, operational efficiency.
- **KPI Highlights**:
  - OTP completion rate ?98%.
  - Capsule feedback ?4.5/5.
  - Reduced motion adoption ?20%.
  - Release on-time ?95%.
- **Funnels**:
  - OTP: `view ? digit_entered ? success/error ? method_switch ? success_fallback`.
  - Capsule: `view ? select ? active ? feedback`.
  - Settings: `view ? change ? toggle ? sync_success`.
- **Dashboards** (Looker): OTP Quality, Capsule Engagement, Accessibility Scorecard, Operational Efficiency.
- **Data Governance**: `snake_case` event params, include `capsule_id`, `theme_variant`, `a11y_flags`, raw event retention 13 months.

## 5. Journey & Persona Artifacts
- **Journey Map**: Anticipation (marketing touchpoints), Verification (OTP screen), Celebration (success reveal), Continuation (gallery & settings). Pain points: OTP expiry, motion discomfort, personalization awareness. Delight: signature illustration, weekly preview.
- **Persona Snapshots**: Motivations, behaviors, needs, accessibility considerations consolidated in Experience Handbook (?1).

## 7. Backlog & Prioritization
- **States**: Idea Pool ? Concept Sprint ? Production ? QA Ready ? Scheduled ? Live ? Archive.
- **Sample Backlog**:
  - SPR-01 Morning Dew (Spring, production, release Mar 1).
  - SUM-01 Neon Mirage (concept sprint, release Jun 10).
  - WK-MON Monday Reset (scheduled Sep 22; QA complete).
  - EVT-NY New Year Prism (idea pool, needs marketing alignment).
- **Risk Register** (top items): schedule overlap between seasonal & special (mitigate with 3-week buffer), shader FPS drops (fallback textures + benchmarks), localization lag (early engagement), telemetry inconsistencies (standardize event wrapper).

## 8. Testing & Validation
- **Prototype Testing Protocol**: Define objectives, recruit 5+ participants, run interactive & motion prototypes, evaluate completion time, emotional response, motion comfort, accessibility compliance.
- **Accessibility Plan**: Automation (Axe), expert review each sprint, panel of 8 quarterly, assistive tech matrix across devices; metrics include zero critical defects and remediation <1 sprint.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Device tiers (iPhone 14 Pro ? Moto G Power), scenarios (OTP default/reduced motion, capsule switch, settings), metrics (FPS ?55, frame build <16ms, CPU <40%). Report per sprint.

## 9. Roadmap Synchronization
- **Phases**:
  - Phase 2: Core features (OTP screens, main screens, AI module).
  - Phase 3: Advanced features (Wardrobe, shopping, social).
  - Phase 4+: Backend, QA, deployment, polish.
- **Critical Path**: Authentication ? Main screens ? AI module; Shopping ? Backend ? Testing; Performance ? Deployment ? Launch.

## 10. Governance
- Weekly Capsule kickoff (Monday), Laboratory session (Wednesday), Gallery walk (Friday).
