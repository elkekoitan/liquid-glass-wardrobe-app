## 1. Vision & Narrative
- **Promise**: Frictionless yet sensorial multifactor authentication that feels like entering a couture-grade vault.
- **Narrative Pillars**: Ethereal trust, couture detail, ritualized joy.
- **Experience Arcs**:
  - *Arrive ? Delight ? Verify ? Continue Story*.
  - *Seasonal capsule onboarding ? Daily verification ritual ? Surprise moment*.
- **Personas**:
  - *Style Maven*: Seeks premium, calm OTP ritual with clear confirmations.
  - *On-the-go Creator*: Needs fast, low-motion flow and dependable fallbacks.
  - *Security Guardian*: Values transparent status, accessibility controls for teams.

## 2. Competitive Signals & Differentiators
- Enterprise MFA tools (Google, Microsoft, Okta) deliver trust but lack warmth and personalization.
- Lifestyle security apps (Authy, 1Password) show polish yet inconsistent storytelling.
- Cross-industry inspiration (Revolut, Aesop, Nowness, Nothing) informs glass textures, motion choreography, editorial tone.
- **Differentiation Pillars**: Living capsules, analog + digital fusion, multisensory depth, ritual framing.

## 3. Design Language System
### 3.1 Color Architecture
| Tier | Palette | Hex | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base Glass | Mist Quartz | #E8EEF2 | Primary substrate (40% opacity) |
| Dark Anchor | Abyss Slate | #0D1218 | Text, deep backgrounds |
| Accent | Prism Orchid | #C69EFF | CTAs, progress rings (?10%) |
| Accent | Neon Tide | #00E0D2 | Focus states, capsule indicators |
| Support | Ember Veil | #FFB082 | Success, seasonal handoff |
| Alert | Copper Pulse | #FF6F61 | Error glow |

**Gradient Recipes**: Aurora Veil (Mist Quartz ? Prism Orchid 120?), Glacial Shift (Abyss Slate ? Neon Tide radial), Afterglow (Ember Veil ? Copper Pulse 45? with 5% noise).

### 3.2 Typography
- Primary: "S?hne" variable (300-700). Fallback: Inter, SF Pro, Roboto.
- Display 36/40, Body 16/24, Caption 12/16. Tabular figures for OTP digits.
- Enable stylistic alternates for seasonal headlines; keep OTP copy utilitarian.

### 3.3 Iconography & Illustration
- 1.5pt line icons with 4px radius, inner shadow 12%.
- Signature illustration: analog ink blots blended with volumetric light.
- Each capsule includes *one* signature detail (texture or illustration) plus *one* dynamic element (parallax, light flare).

### 3.4 Layout & Components
- Baseline grid 8px (4px micro adjustments). Safe zones 24px top/bottom.
- Glass elevation levels: 0 background (blur 48), 1 passive (blur 24), 2 primary cards (blur 18 + inner glow), 3 CTA/dialogs (blur 14 + Neon Tide outline).

- **Microcopy Panel**: Two-column layout, seasonal badge slot, high-contrast fallback.

### 3.5 Microcopy Voice
- **Principles**: Sensory precision, warm assurance, concise storytelling.
- **Templates**: `Welcome back, {name}. Your style vault awaits.` / `Verified. Let the look unfold.` / `Digits didn?t align. Let?s try again.`
- **Seasonal Keywords**:
  - Spring: bloom, dew, dawn.
  - Summer: blaze, horizon, pulse.
  - Autumn: ember, dusk, hush.
  - Winter: frost, glow, hush.
  - New Year: prism, countdown, ignite.
- Accessibility: Lead with instruction before metaphor, Grade 7-8 reading level.

## 4. Motion & Sensory System
- **Timing Sets**: Enter 320ms ease-out; Exit 240ms ease-in; Micro-confirm 120ms spring.
- **Primitives**:
  - OTP digit ripple (scale 1.0?1.08, blur 0?12, 260ms, light haptic, soft tick audio).
  - Capsule slide transition (480ms, parallax offset 40%, medium haptic, capsule swipe audio).
  - Error glow (Copper Pulse ? Ember Veil, shake 5?, sharp double haptic).
  - Hero light sweep (1600ms loop, disable on reduced motion).
- **Haptic Map**: Light (UIImpactFeedbackStyle.light / HapticFeedbackType.lightImpact), Medium, Sharp Double for errors.
- **Reduced Motion**: Swap slide for crossfade (260ms linear), disable hero sweep.
- **Audio Palette**: Soft glass chimes (A4/C5), success triad, error hush.

## 5. Experience Architecture
### 5.1 Journey Stages
1. **Anticipation**: Notifications and previews build mood. KPIs: notification CTR, preview views.
2. **Verification**: OTP screen clarity, sensory feedback, accessibility aids. KPIs: completion time, error rate.
3. **Celebration**: Success ripple, share invitation, preview next capsule. KPIs: satisfaction score, share rate.
4. **Continuation**: Capsule gallery, personalization toggles, weekly drops. KPIs: capsule adoption, settings usage.

### 5.2 Accessibility
- Contrast ratio ? 4.5:1, high-contrast palette (Abyss Slate + Neon Tide).
- Screen reader labels: "OTP digit {n}"; timers announced.
- Reduced motion toggle accessible within two taps; disables parallax, hero sweep.
- Validation plan covers automation (Axe), expert audits, user panel of eight quarterly, assistive tech matrix (VoiceOver, TalkBack, zoom, keyboard).

## 6. Capsule System

- **Sound Palette**: Source low-volume chimes from Ableton Packs, Nothing phone sound design, and custom field recordings (glass taps) for success cues.

**Moodboard Workflow**
1. Research agent gathers 6â€“8 references per theme (OTP, capsule, personalization, motion, sound) every Thursday.
2. Creative Director curates into master board in Figma (separate pages per flow) by Friday 12:00.
3. Lead UI + Motion annotate design implications (color, material, timing) before Monday Capsule Kickoff.
4. Heritage board updated monthly with best-in-class inspiration + shipped screenshots for parity tracking.
