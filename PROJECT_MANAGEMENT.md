## 🔄 Latest Progress (2025-09-18)
- Home surfaces adapt to personalization: high contrast palette, reduced-motion falls back, and glass buttons gate haptics/sound settings.
- Capsule gallery and action controls now mirror personalization: contrast-aware surfaces, reduced motion toggles, and disabled buttons mute feedback.
- Onboarding and OTP flows now honour personalization defaults and ditch deprecated opacity helpers across the design system.
- Analyzer pass now clean: deprecated opacity replaced project-wide, async context fixes applied, and smoke test updated.
- Linked home quick actions to live capsule, personalization, and OTP flows.
- Capsule gallery now honors personalization defaults and allows in-app activation with feedback.
- OTP experience loads the preferred capsule and responds to reduced motion, high contrast, haptics, and sound toggles.
- Personalization provider is initialized globally on app start to share settings across screens.
